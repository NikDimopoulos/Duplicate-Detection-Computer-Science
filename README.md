# Duplicate-Detection-Computer-Science
Nowadays, consumers spend a large amount of time searching online for different products in order to find the one that meets their needs. However, there is a vast number of sites,which sometimes may present the very same product in a different way. As a result, coming up with a method of recognizing the same items in different webshops would be quite useful for the customer. However, trying to track down the duplicates manually is quite a challenging and annoying procedure.
The aim of this project is to construct a Python code that receives a dataset of 1624 TV items from 4 different sites and detects the duplicates. This dataset can be found in the "TVs-all-merged.json" file, which includes the following information for every observation: shop, modelID, URL and title. The modelID is the unique code that corresponds to each and every product, helping both consumers and sellers to identify a specfic item. However, sometimes it may be the case that a webshop does not accompany its products with this handy code, for this reason it is used on this code only as a means of validating the pairs predicted by the code. The stages executed by the code are the following:
1. Data Cleaning- Standardizing the units (for example inch can be expressed in multiple ways  "-inch", """, " inches")
